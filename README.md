This is a test project for frontend. please review on widescreen. more info on home section.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

## Development server

Run npm I to install dependencies before runing the server.
Use Yarn if you prefere.
This is a repo that i've presented a long time ago and I have been improving it but eventually left it.


The main idea is to use this very same with rxjs and ngrx. Due time is not done yet. 

Hope you enjoy and give me ideas to improve!
Regards for reading this lines!
